TODO:
        - Categories are hard-coded. This should be changed to something more dynamic.
            - Regex?
            - let the user choose to what Category each newly found company belong.
        - Add functionality to keep track of "other_expenses"
        - Add GUI functionality to choose what month you wish to look at.
            - Drop down menu at the top containing each month.
        - Add drop-down menu in the GUI to choose other months from the history folder.
        - Add income amount and display total +/- earnings of the month.
        - Keep the different categories in a separate text file to reduce the clutter in the code.
        - Make the plot interactive.
            - If you click on a category a list should appear with each transaction within that category.
        - If a category is 0 it should not appear on the plot.
        - Refactor the code. Extract code that are similar in order to reduce clutter.

        New Feature idea:
        - Display the output in a staple graph.
        - New feature: Import the budget for each month
            - display the budget for each category into a staple graph
            - See the budgeted output in the same graph to see if I exceed the targeted output.
